        "While rival muscle cars have pivoted recently toward sharp handling, the 2023 Dodge Challenger keeps things retro with a package that’s designed more for old-school pony-car jollies and straight-line speed. A V-6 engine is standard in these non-SRT Challengers but the real fun comes with the optional naturally aspirated Hemi V-8 engines, which are offered in a variety of displacements and outputs spanning a 375-hp, 5.7-liter to a 485-hp, 6.4-liter. If you want even more power, Dodge will be happy to oblige with the big-stomper Challenger SRT Hellcat, which we review separately. The regular Challenger isn’t as intense as the outrageous Hellcat, but for some its V-8 burble and relatively comfortable ride will be enough to trigger nostalgic feelings for the vintage Dodge pony cars with which it shares a name.",

        "If you avoid the pricier trims and engines, the Volkswagen T-Roc is a fine buy. Its hushed refinement makes it one of the most comfortable cars in the class, while its spacious interior and big boot will appeal to families. Also, its high-set driving position is just what SUV buyers crave – and something many other small SUVs fail to deliver. Entry-level Life trim is our pick of the bunch, because it keeps costs down while also coming with plenty of standard equipment. That includes 16in alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, automatic front windscreen wipers, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, two-zone climate control, adaptive cruise control, adjustable lumbar support, an 8.0in digital driver display and a 6.25in touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth, DAB radio and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone mirroring.",

        "Exceptionally sporty and exceedingly luxurious, the E43 has been transformed by AMG from a regular E-Class sedan into an equilibrium of excellence by adding a specially tuned 396-hp twin-turbo V-6 and a nine-speed automatic transmission. This sophisticated cruiser also features standard air suspension and all-wheel drive for adroit handling. The E43 boasts an assertive exterior and an extravagant interior that is equally high tech and high class, with exotic materials and a fully digitized dashboard. For blending all of these attributes in an irresistible fashion, the E43 finds itself on our list of 10Best Cars for 2018. Mercedes-AMG built a nearly flawless sports sedan with the debut of the E43 in 2017. It checked all the boxes of what constitutes performance and class. That winning combination is enough for the company to send it into 2018 with a single change: black leatherette upholstery with red stitching is now standard.",

A5 Sportback 40 model has 201 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque, while A5 Sportback 45 model gains an additional 60 horsepower and 40 pound-feet of torque. A rich breadth of standard niceties such as high-quality leather, a panoramic sunroof, and moody ambient lighting make even the base A5 Sportback feel plush. While rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz C-class or Genesis G70 have arguably more stylish interiors, the Sportback’s is butressed by an incredibly clear and high-tech digital gauge display with available navigation handled by Google Earth imagery.",

        "Few cars are capable of serving the gods of both comfort and sportiness as well as the 2023 BMW 3-series sedan. This perennial favorite can be outfitted as a corner-carving sports sedan or a well-appointed entry-luxury car—or a combination of both. Its three available turbocharged powertrains deftly walk the line between power and polish. The entry-level 330i and plug-in hybrid 330e offer impressive performance with above average fuel economy, while the turbocharged inline-six in the top-dog M340i packs 382 of the biggest, strongest horses this side of the Bavarian Alps. The 3-series doesn’t have the style of the Alfa Romeo Giulia or the value-packed features list of the Genesis G70, but it’s so well-rounded, athletic, and engaging to drive that it stands at the very top of our segment rankings. BMW’s quintessential sports sedan gets a tech-heavy makeover for 2023 that sees updated exterior styling and a dramatic new all-digital dashboard. Keen eyes will notice that this same monolithic display that stretches two-thirds of the 3-series’s dashboard is the same design as what you’ll find in the brand’s flagship 7-series and electric iX SUV. The wall of screens runs BMW’s iDrive 8 interface and includes standard navigation, a voice assistant, and a 5G Wi-FI hotspot.",

        "Dongfeng Sokon is a joint venture between Dongfeng and Chongqing Sokon group and has become the 2nd largest automobile company in China. It entered the Pakistani automobile market through Regal Automobiles Industries Limited after it acquired a Greenfield status under the Auto Development Policy of 2016 to 2021. It has launched DFSK Glory Pro, a crossover SUV, and a K01S Mini truck in Pakistan. Now it is time for Seres 3 to launch in Pakistan and the much speculated Seres 3 test units have arrived at the Karachi port. Another vehicle DFSK 500, is expected by DFSK in Pakistan. Subcompact SUVs have become immensely popular in Pakistan in a couple of years, and automobile companies are manufacturing SUVs locally in Pakistan. The SERES 3 by DFSK is an all-electric subcompact SUV, having a similar design to DFSK Glory 500, and will give great competition to MG ZS EV. All-electric SUVs are not very common in Pakistani markets, and thus DFSK SERES 3 will have less competition in the market. It will be developed on a pure electric SUV platform, delivering an exceptionally-powerful performance. It offers a spacious interior, and the cabin comes with a neat finish, and a 10.25-inches screen gives infotainment, while fairly-good materials are used inside the car. It is known as Fengon E3 in China and DFSK Glory Seres 3 in export markets. It was expected in Pakistan by the end of 2021 but, its launch was postponed and has an expected launch in the next couple of years.The DFSK SERES 3 is available in only one version. It will offer only one battery size, and the features and specs will be given as standard. It will provide variations in exterior colors. You can purchase it in red, white, and blue exterior colors. Standard features include a panoramic sunroof, a 360-degree camera; 18-inch alloy wheels, and metallic paint.",

        "The BMW 1 Series has been a staple contender among premium family hatchbacks for many years, appealing to anyone looking to mix practicality with a dose of glamour. This latest, third-generation 1 Series has one big change that's upset a few enthusiasts, though – it's driven by its front wheels rather than being rear-wheel drive. However, for most buyers, that's actually made it a far more accomplished family car. åYou see, the truth is, previous generations of the BMW 1 Series weren’t as good to drive as the 'Ultimate Driving Machine' hype suggested anyway, with only more powerful (and expensive) versions able to take full advantage of the rear-wheel-drive layout. åOn this latest model, BMW gives you a choice of petrol and diesel engines, and you can get four-wheel drive for extra road-holding on some of the pricier versions. Indeed, many of the mechanicals are taken from the BMW X1 and BMW X2 SUVs. åHere, we'll be finding out how the BMW 1 Series stacks up against a range of alternatives, such as the Audi A3 and Mercedes A-Class – as well as more mainstream alternatives, including the Mazda 3 and Volkswagen Golf. We'll also tell you which engine and trim combination make the most sense.",

        "The 2022 Dodge Charger has the distinction of being the only V-8-powered sedan that starts under $40,000. While the Chrysler 300 also offers a V-8 with a rear-wheel-drive layout, it's fancier and pricier. The Charger is less refined, with questionable interior quality and an overly firm ride that gets worse on the optional 20-inch wheels. As with the Dodge Challenger coupe, it has a standard V-6 and available all-wheel drive. However, the most exciting Charger has a vociferous Hemi V-8 under the hood, either a 370-hp 5.7-liter or a 485-hp 6.4-liter. The latter is reserved for the Scat Pack model, which isn't as aggro as the separately reviewed 700-plus-hp Charger SRT Hellcat, but it is the sportiest non-SRT model and offers a distinctive widebody appearance. Although not everyone will appreciate the 2022 Charger, anyone who wants a throwback sedan with countless nostalgic character will. For 2022, Dodge makes only small changes to the Charger lineup. The Driver Convenience Group package now includes a deluxe security alarm, which should come in handy in the event that anyone tries to boost (read: steal) an owner's prized ride. The alarm is also now standard on Scat Pack models, too.",

        "The 2023 Range Rover Evoque is the fashionista of the subcompact-SUV class, and it’s guaranteed to turn heads. Unfortunately, its practical attributes don't measure up to those of the segment’s leaders. Neither its cargo capacity nor interior space are as generous as in rivals such as the BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz GLB-class, and Volvo XC40. Those SUVs also provide more driving enjoyment than the Evoque. The Evoque offers a choice of two turbocharged four-cylinder engines but neither will save you much at the pump, as their fuel efficiency is mediocre. Ultimately, the Evoque's charm lies in its eye-catching design, tailored cabin, and luxury-brand cachet. Plus, its tall seating position gives it a more SUV-like feel than some lower-riding rivals. The Evoque is powered by a 246-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder dubbed P250, and it comes standard with a nine-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. At our test track, the Evoque delivered a 7.1-second zero-to-60-mph run. Rivals such as the BMW X1 and the Volvo XC40 delivered slightly quicker times, but the Land Rover is still competitively lively. The more powerful P300 powertrain is limited to the top-spec HST R-Dynamic. That engine makes a stout 296 horsepower and is assisted by a 48-volt hybrid system; at our test track the P300 managed a 6.6-second zero-to-60-mph time. On the road, there's no mistaking the Evoque for a hatchback car as you can with the X1. It feels substantial, and the seat height is SUV appropriate; it handles corners adequately but won't satisfy enthusiast drivers in the same way as the BMW or Mercedes-Benz GLA-class.",

        "The reincarnated Mini Cooper made its debut in North America twenty years ago and it's still just as stylish and fun to drive as it was back then. Its retro-modern styling still turns heads, and its sporty chassis tuning gives drivers something to look forward to every time they slide behind the wheel. Offered as either a two-door hatchback, a four-door hatchback, or a convertible, the Cooper isn't particularly practical, but for singles or couples, the smallest Mini model still has appeal. Standard models are powered by a 134-hp turbocharged three-cylinder, but going with an S model swaps that for a spunky 189-hp turbo four, which offers much better acceleration. Unfortunately, doing so also raises the Cooper's price significantly, coming very close in price to luxury-branded cars such as the BMW 2-series Gran Coupe and the Mercedes-Benz A-class. Need more performance than the regular Cooper can provide? Check out the Cooper JCW (reviewed separately), which boasts a fiery 302-hp turbo engine. The standard engine is a 134-hp turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder, which provides adequate pep in this small, lightweight, front-drive vehicle. We prefer the S models, which come with a 189-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. With the larger engine, the S proved to be a little more than a second faster to 60 mph than with the base 1.5-liter engine, clocking in at 6.2 seconds. We found the automatic transmission shifts well, but the manual transmission is still our favorite as it provides the most driver engagement. The firm suspension lends itself to enthusiast-oriented driving, which can make the Mini Cooper exciting, but the ride can be unforgiving on rough roads.",

        "With designer looks and twin-turbo power, the 2022 Maserati Ghibli brings a ton of Italian attitude to the mid-size luxury sedan party. Four-cylinder engines be damned, the Ghibli offers a 345-hp twin-turbo V-6 as standard while upper trims come with either a 424-hp version of that engine or a 580-hp twin-turbo V-8. To go along with its powerful engines, the Ghibli's chassis is set up for driving thrills—it's a joy to pitch down a curvy back road. Unfortunately, it may be too focused on fun, as the Ghibli doesn't stack up well against rivals in the luxury and comfort categories, as its rear seat is less accommodating than rivals such as the Audi A6 or the Mercedes-Benz E-class. A host of leather, wood, and metal trims dot the Ghibli's cabin to upscale effect, but several knobs and switches appear to be lifted directly from the Stellantis (Maserati's parent company) parts bin. Still, the Maserati's styling and performance make it endearing, plus its relative obscurity means it turns heads like Italian exotics from Ferrari and Lamborghini. Maserati has simplified the Ghibli's lineup for 2022 and created three distinct trim levels, starting with the 345-hp GT, then graduating to the 424-hp Modena and then the beastly 580-hp Trofeo. The GT presents a more luxury-oriented design while the Modena and Trofeo lean heavily on more aggressive design themes to project their performance. The Ghibli now comes standard with a host of driver-assistance features, including adaptive cruise control and automated emergency braking.",

        "Cats are solitary creatures, and true to form, Jaguar has only one gasoline-powered sedan in its lineup now amid the massive popularity of SUVs and a looming push toward electrification. The XF sticks around for another lap around the sun but is long overdue for a redesign to help it compete against newer sedans such as the Mercedes-Benz E-class, Genesis G80, and Audi A7. Meanwhile, the XF P250 comes standard with rear-wheel drive, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and a 246-hp turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The P300 version boosts output to 296 hp and is strictly an all-wheel-drive model. While the XF’s powertrain offerings are limited in size and power, its price makes it the most affordable entry in the mid-size-luxury-car segment. Its interior features handsome materials has plenty of tech, and the XF combines the plushness and ride of a big sedan with surefooted handling. Its maneuverability at reasonable speeds is downright catlike. Unfortunately, it’s not enough; this feline is clearly showing its age. The XF is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that comes in two potencies. The P250 version produces 246 horsepower, and the P300 generates 296 horses. Both engines mate to an eight-speed automatic transmission, but only the less powerful one offers rear- or all-wheel drive. The P300 comes exclusively with all-wheel drive. While we haven't had the opportunity to test both versions at the track, we have driven the more powerful one. It hit 60 mph in 6.2 seconds, which is slower than the now-defunct supercharged V-6 model, but the Jag's exhaust still sounds good. We appreciated the Jag's supple suspension, which delivered fluid handling along with exceptional ride quality. The XF's steering transitioned adeptly between low-speed lightness and high-speed heft. The soft brake pedal had a gradual response, too.",
